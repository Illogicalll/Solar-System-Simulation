# Solar-System-Simulation
A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment Project


This project is intended to be an educational tool for GCSE Physics Students. It will serve as an aid/semi-replacement for lecture-like
lessons about the Solar System that many younger students have trouble focussing in. My aim is to help solve the focus problem by
introducing an interactive element where there usually wouldn't be one. My application will grant students the ability to play God and
discover the behaviour of the orbits of astronomical bodies and how their mass and the overall gravitational strength affect them.
